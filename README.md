# A Whale-off portfolio.
## Moh Jaiswal

This repository delves into Portfolio performance and risk metrics, where I develop my own portfolio, compared it to big name ones, alogrithmic trading instruments and S&P TSX 60 indices. The research and results are all stated in the whale_analysis.ipynb file.
