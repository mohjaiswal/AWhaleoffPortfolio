# A Whale Off the Portfolio

## Description

This repository delves into Portfolio performance and risk metrics, where I develop my own portfolio, compared it to big-name ones, algorithmic trading instruments, and S&P TSX 60 indices.

## Visuals
You can find visualization graphics, such as plots and figures, in the associated Jupyter Notebook.

## Installation

Before you begin, you will need to install the necessary Python libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib. To run the provided analysis code, clone this repository and make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Usage

The primary usage for this project involves conducting quantitative analysis on investment portfolios. The associated Jupyter Notebook `whale_analysis.ipynb` contains code and explanations to perform the following tasks:
- Read and clean historical returns data from multiple portfolios.
- Calculate and analyze daily returns and cumulative returns.
- Evaluate risk by calculating standard deviations.
- Determine correlations between portfolios and rolling statistics.
- Calculate Sharpe ratios to assess risk-adjusted returns.

Note: If you are unable to open the notebook, there is a PDF attached for your perusal. 

You will also find important insights from the analysis, such as:
- Whale and Algo portfolios are both riskier than TSX 60.
- Correlation between portfolios and TSX 60, with Algo 2 having the highest correlation of 0.83, making it the most similar to TSX 60.
- Determining whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P TSX 60) and the whales' portfolios, which, based on Sharpe ratios, they do.
